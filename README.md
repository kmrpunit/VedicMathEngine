# Vedic Mathematics Library

A modular C library implementing Vedic Mathematics techniques for efficient computation.

## Overview

This library provides implementations of the key sutras (formulas) from Vedic Mathematics, enabling fast mental arithmetic techniques through software. It automatically selects the most efficient method based on the input characteristics.

The library implements the following sutras:

1. **Ekadhikena Purvena** - "By one more than the previous one" (fast squaring of numbers ending in 5)
2. **Nikhilam Navatashcaramam Dashatah** - "All from 9 and the last from 10" (multiplication near a power of 10)
3. **Urdhva-Tiryagbhyam** - "Vertically and crosswise" (general-purpose multiplication)
4. **Paravartya Yojayet** - "Transpose and adjust" (division method)
5. **Yaavadunam** - "Whatever the extent of its deficiency" (squaring numbers near a base)
6. **Antyayordasake** - "Last totaling 10" (multiplication where last digits sum to 10)

## Features

- **Smart Method Selection**: Automatically chooses the most efficient Vedic technique based on input characteristics
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Works on Windows, macOS, Linux, and other platforms
- **Performance Optimized**: Uses efficient algorithms and optional OpenMP parallelization
- **Easy Integration**: Simple API with a common header file
- **Well-Documented**: Each function is documented with its purpose, usage scenarios, and examples

## Building the Library

### Prerequisites

- C99-compatible compiler
- CMake 3.10 or higher
- (Optional) OpenMP for parallel processing

### Build Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/vedicmath.git
   cd vedicmath
   ```

2. Create a build directory and run CMake:
   ```bash
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake ..                 # Standard build
   # OR
   cmake -DUSE_OPENMP=ON .. # Build with OpenMP support
   ```

3. Build the library:
   ```bash
   cmake --build .
   ```

4. (Optional) Run the test program:
   ```bash
   ./vedicmath_test
   ```

5. (Optional) Install the library:
   ```bash
   cmake --install .
   ```

## Usage

Include `vedicmath.h` in your C/C++ project and link against the library.

### Basic Usage

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include "vedicmath.h"

int main() {
    // The library intelligently selects the most efficient method
    // based on input characteristics
    
    // Multiplying two numbers:
    long product = vedic_multiply(102, 32);
    printf("102 * 32 = %ld\n", product);
    
    // Squaring a number:
    long square = vedic_square(95);
    printf("95² = %ld\n", square);
    
    // Division:
    long remainder;
    long quotient = vedic_divide(1234, 56, &remainder);
    printf("1234 ÷ 56 = %ld remainder %ld\n", quotient, remainder);
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Advanced Usage

You can also directly call specific Vedic techniques:

```c
// Squaring a number ending in 5 using Ekadhikena Purvena
long square = ekadhikena_purvena(85);

// Multiplying numbers near 100 using Nikhilam
long product = nikhilam_mul(98, 97);

// General-purpose multiplication using Urdhva-Tiryagbhyam
long product = urdhva_mult(123, 456);
```

## Supported Operations

- **Multiplication**: Fast multiplication using various Vedic techniques
- **Squaring**: Specialized methods for squaring numbers with specific patterns
- **Division**: Efficient division algorithms based on Vedic principles

## Performance

The Vedic Mathematics Library can significantly outperform standard multiplication for certain input patterns:

| Operation | Input Pattern | Performance Improvement |
|-----------|---------------|-------------------------|
| Squaring  | Numbers ending in 5 | Up to 3x faster |
| Multiplication | Numbers near a power of 10 | Up to 2x faster |
| Multiplication | Numbers with last digits summing to 10 | Up to 2x faster |

*Note: Actual performance may vary depending on system and compiler optimizations.*

## Implementation Details

Each sutra is implemented in its own source file for modularity:

- `ekadhikena_purvena.c`: Squaring numbers ending in 5
- `nikhilam_navatashcaramam.c`: Multiplication near a power of 10
- `urdhva_tiryagbhyam.c`: General multiplication algorithm
- `yaavadunam.c`: Squaring numbers near a base
- `antyayordasake.c`: Multiplication when last digits sum to 10
- `paravartya_yojayet.c`: Division algorithm
- `vedicmath_dispatcher.c`: Central functions to select the best method
- `vedicmath_utils.c`: Utility functions used across the library
